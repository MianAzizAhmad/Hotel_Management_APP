# Hotel_Management_APP
An Android App developed which connects hostel owner and students who are looking for hostels. 
Consists of single login page for both student and hostel manager. And seperate sign up pages for both people.
The data of the Application is stored in the firebase database.
Upon login student can see which hostel and its room he is staying in and how many days are left till next rent.
If he/she haven't rented a room yet then he can can click on a button named look for rooms which takes to the next UI which contains the information of different hostel room available
for renting. Upon clicking any of them their whole information (length, width, rent fee, room image etc) is available and a button to request to rent it if student likes it.
Similarly when a hostel manager logs in he/she can view information regarding their hostel and can add another room for rent.
